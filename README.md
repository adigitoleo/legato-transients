### Project Goal:
- To investigate general characteristics of legato transients in woodwind instruments, with specific focus on the fute. The effects of degree of key opening and speed of key motion are targeted. Only single-key (single-finger) transitions are analyzed. Transition times are obtained from time domain data, and effective key opening (and inertance) values from the frequency domain.

### Characteristic transitions:

### Effective key opening:

### Effective tone-hole inertance:
