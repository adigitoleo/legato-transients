### Project Goal:
- To investigate general characteristics of legato transients in woodwind instruments, with specific focus on the flute. The analysis is primarily focused on speed of key motion and duration of frequency variation. Only single-key (single-finger) transitions are analyzed. Transition times are obtained from time domain data, and effective key opening (and inertance) values from the frequency domain. Constant blowing pressure (amplitude) is maintained by an artificial pump system. Selected trials are recorded for three fixed pressure levels, and qualitative observations of the effects on transition characteristics are discussed.

### Effective key opening:
 - In order to quantatively compare transitions based on the speed of the inducing geometry change or the duration of the frequency stabilisation it is necessary to define initial and final states of the geometry. Since the mechanical keys of a flute are restrained in an open position by a spring and stopper and in a closed position by downward compression of a pad against the tone hole chimney, both states are acoustically arbitrary. (...)
 - Instead, the effective opening and effective closing values are determined via acoustic response. The transfer functions (internal/external) of acoustic spectra are measured for various increments of key closure. A sound source situated outside the tone hole emits a reproducible broadband signal which is detected by calibrated microphones both inside and outside the hole. This experiment was performed on a B-foot of a Boehm flute with both ends plugged by stoppers. In this configuration, the foot joint acts as a Helmholtz resonator in the (acoustically) open state, but not when acoustically closed. The effective inertance of the air in the chimney is also calculated.
 - Results from the above compared with variations in sound level and frequency for a hybrid flute with recorder mouthpiece. Key position again adjusted in increments. Recorder mouthpiece attached for simplicity of blowing mechanism.

### Characteristic transitions:
- After defining effective transition geometry, the speed of the mechanical transition can be calculated. Transitions can be characterised into fast, slow, and openiong transitions. Since key opening is mainly determined by spring stiffness, the speed does not vary as much as for closing. (...) (Q: How does mechanical transition speed affect power variation, stability of second note, harmonics?, beating effects - interference?)
- Since transitions typically occur within small timescales (result - how long on average, classify short vs long?), it is hard to obtain meaningful frequency information by spectrum analysis. Instead, the time-domain periods of the waveform can be obtained from zero crossings (maxima easier?).
- (Blowing pressure effects? More harmonics? Longer transitions?)
