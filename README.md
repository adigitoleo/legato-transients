- need to update requirements.txt to include audacity.py and peak finding packages
- found PeakUtils package, might be useful instead of sig.argrelmax -> signal[args], also could be used to find main peaks in distribution of light signal amplitude -> get max and min steady state values for conversion to displacement in metres (use experimentally measured key open distance)
